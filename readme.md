## Folder structure

sore-mirror/   
The drone simulation runs in the p5JS project here. 

controller/  
The thing which will ouput thrust for the drone based on position info given by the sore-mirror

server/  
It will take messages from controller and sore-mirror and pass it on. It runs on websockets so latency is ðŸ¤Œ.
